# [MyWebsite](http://lukasbuehler.ch)
This repo holds all the code for my personal website. 
That way anyone can use my website and copy some things if they'd like to.

## How does it work?
My webpage is obviously based on HTML and CSS but I am also using [Bootsrap](https://bootstrap.com).
Bootstrap helps you create good looking, fast and responsive webpages really quickly. I personally started off with a template from W3 Schools that I found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/).

## Note
Keep in mind that this repo just holds all the necessairy code for my webpage and doesn't necessairily hold it's contents - for example images and files and maybe also some text. That's why you might get some reference errors when just copy pasting everything - What you shouldn't do anyway right? :wink: 

Also keep in mind that the code to projects that are embedded in the webpage aren't in this repo either, they have their own repository. The link to those you will find on my webpage itself. 

## You are awesome!
Always love it when people check out my work, cheers mate. :smile:
